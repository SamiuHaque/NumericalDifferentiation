# NumericalDifferentiation
This MATLAB program is designed to analyze datasets by generating a function based on the provided data. It then conducts differentiation on the generated function. The program utilizes Newton's Forward/Backward Difference and Stirling's method for this purpose, which requires that the interval of the independent variable remains consistent across the dataset.

Here's a summary of the steps the program takes:

<ol><b>Function Generation:</b> The program evaluates the provided datasets to generate a function that approximates the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It uses techniques like Newton's Forward/Backward Difference and Stirling's method.</ol>

<ol><b>Differentiation:</b> The program performs differentiation up to a specified order on the generated function.</ol>
<ol><b>Evaluation:</b> After differentiation, the program allows users to evaluate either the original function or its derivative at specified points of interest.</ol>
<ol><b>Note on Interval:</b> The datasets must have equal intervals for the independent variable to ensure accurate results when using techniques like Newton's Forward/Backward Difference and Stirling's method.</ol>
